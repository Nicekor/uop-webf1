        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        <p>
          At this week it was told us to start this document called "Discovery Log" where we should write all the new things that we learn, this way we can check it later if we do not remind them. We started working with our VM, I had already tried it at the INDADD
          unit, learned some commands at the chrome secure shell to login, change password, run a web server and access a database. Then I checked the deadline for our first coursework (the literature review) and I starred the coursework page so i can
          easily find it later in the year. The first deadline is at 2017-11-03 16:00 so what i can do to plan for this deadline it’s to start working today and don’t left anything for the last days. At the Website Awards Google Form i chosed Google because
          of the huge number of simple and free tools that it gives to their users. Then we had to choose and Editor to start creating our web pages, I chose the Notepad++ because it was the only tool that I have heard of.

          This week I worked with a classmate, we shared a document with Google Drive with the title of “WebF1 Security Policy Task” and then we identified and categorised the all the information that we generate on a day to day basis. We realized that we generate
          a lot of our personal information on the web and that was a great help to start writing the literature review whose main theme was the web security.

        <p>
          At this week it was given to us some tips of how to start the coursework. The main tip was that we should start reading through the topic and take notes of it. It was said to that we shouln't use use Wikipedia/other encyclopedia/dictionaries as sources
          in a literature review, but they’re fine if we need to begin understanding concepts that will enable you to interpret academic literature. I found some good sources at Google Scholar and at the <a href="https://library.port.ac.uk/">https://library.port.ac.uk/</a>.
          I learned the referencing system for and academy report as well (in this case the literature review) and the <a href="http://referencing.port.ac.uk/">http://referencing.port.ac.uk/</a> was really useful for that. I actually discovered a plugin
          for Microsoft Word called Mendeley which is really usefull for helping me with citation and referencing.

        <h3>Week 5</h3>
        <p>
          This week was focused in improving my writing, this was one was really helpfull for me. We made a worksheet with varied exercises, the ones that mainly helped me were those to replace several words for only one, and those of "avoiding personal writing"
          because the literature review had a limit of words and we can not give our opinion on it.

        <h3>Week 6</h3>
        <p>
          This week we started learning HTML5 which is a HyperText Markup Language at version 5. I created my first page with the name of <code>"index.html"</code> and used some simple elements like <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code> so we can know that
          it is an html5 document; <code>&lt;title&gt;DarthVader /title</code> which changes the title of the document (it appears on the tab title of the browser); <code>&lt;h1&gt;Darth Vader&lt;/h1&gt;</code> which represents the highest section level
          of headings; and <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello Tatooine&lt;/p&gt;</code> which is a paragraph. I uploaded this page to my Virtual Machine so i could see if it was right and the result of it an this way I could improve my VM knowledge a little bit more.
          I did some research about the differences between html and html5 on youtube and on MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) which is the best website i found for giving me knowledge about web. I discovered that html5 brought a lot of more semantic elements
          so the code of webpages become simpler for other developers to read it, and even for me. Examples of new tags on html5: <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>: For outlining and sectioning; <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>: allow the
          manipulation of new multimedia content; and beside sections, media and forms elements, there are numerous new elements, like <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;data&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>.

        <h3>Week 8</h3>
        <p>
          This week we started working with CSS which styles our HTML5 page so we created our webpage with html5 and then we created other file of .css type so we could style our page. I learned that we can style the webpages at the html document with the style
          element but most of the time the css lines of codes are huge so we should create a file for it and then in the html file we link it with <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" title="My Style" href="mystyle.css"&gt;</code>. I learned that we could give Classes and/or ID's
          to our html elements so then we can easily style them at the css file. I made a research on classes and id's as i did not understand well their differences and when should i use each one. So, i discovered that ID's are used when we only have
          that one element, and classes for the rest of it. A good thing that I learned as well was that I do not need to create classes or id's to all of the elemetns, sometimes it is useless creating it, I can just use the element selector.

          This week we were introduced to an editor called Atom which i did not know and i liked a lot. I experimented it, installed themes to get it pretty for my eyes and installed some packages like "Multi Selectors", "Beautify Code" etc. so I could improve
          my productivity and efficiency on coding. One more time, this was very usefull on creating my website.
